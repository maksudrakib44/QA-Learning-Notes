Testing Terminologies
ðŸ”¹ Software Testing

Software Testing is a method to verify whether a software application meets specified requirements and is defect-free. It involves executing components manually or using tools to evaluate behavior and identify differences between actual and expected outcomes.

ðŸ”¹ Bug / Defect

A bug (or defect) is an error, flaw, or unintended issue in a software application that leads to incorrect or unexpected behavior.

ðŸ”¹ Test Case

A test case is a set of conditions, inputs, and expected results designed to verify whether a specific software function works correctly.

ðŸ”¹ Test Plan

A test plan is a comprehensive document outlining the testing strategy, scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and test deliverables.

ðŸ”¹ Manual Testing

Manual Testing is the process where testers manually execute test cases without automation tools, verifying functionality through human evaluation of user experience.

ðŸ”¹ Automation Testing

Automation Testing uses tools and scripts to automatically execute test cases, enhancing efficiency and consistency, especially for repetitive tasks.

ðŸ”¹ Regression Testing

Regression Testing involves re-running previous tests after changes to ensure that existing functionality remains intact and unaffected by updates.

ðŸ”¹ Levels of Testing

Unit Testing â€“ Tests individual components or modules.

Integration Testing â€“ Tests combined modules for correct interaction.

System Testing â€“ Tests the entire system for both functional and non-functional requirements.

Acceptance Testing â€“ Evaluates whether the system meets user or stakeholder requirements.

ðŸ”¹ Black-box Testing

Black-box Testing assesses software functionality without knowledge of internal code structure. Testers focus solely on inputs and expected outputs.

ðŸ”¹ White-box Testing

White-box Testing involves examining internal logic, design, and code structure of an application. Test cases are created with visibility into source code and internal paths.
