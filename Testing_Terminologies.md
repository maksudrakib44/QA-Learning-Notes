# Testing Terminologies

##  Software Testing
Software Testing is a method to verify whether the software application meets specified requirements and is defect-free. It involves executing components manually or using tools to evaluate behavior and identify differences between actual and expected outcomes.

##  Bug / Defect
A bug (or defect) is an error, flaw, or unintended issue in a software application that leads to incorrect or unexpected behavior.  
*(Derived from general software testing resources.)*

---

##  Test Case
A test case is a set of conditions, inputs, and expected results designed to verify whether a specific software function works correctly.  
*(Common software QA definition.)*

---

##  Test Plan
A test plan is a comprehensive document outlining the testing strategy, scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and test deliverables.  
*(Based on standard QA best practices.)*

---

##  Manual Testing
Manual Testing is the process where testers manually execute test cases without automation tools, verifying functionality through human evaluation of user experience.

##  Automation Testing
Automation Testing uses tools and scripts to automatically execute test cases, enhancing efficiency and consistency, especially for repetitive tasks.

##  Regression Testing
Regression Testing involves re-running previous tests after changes to ensure that existing functionality remains intact and unaffected by updates.  
*(A widely referenced QA concept.)*

##  Levels of Testing
1. **Unit Testing** – Tests individual components or modules.  
2. **Integration Testing** – Tests combined modules for correct interaction.  
3. **System Testing** – Tests the entire system for both functional and non-functional requirements.  
4. **Acceptance Testing** – Evaluates whether the system meets user or stakeholder requirements.

##  Black-box Testing
Black-box Testing assesses software functionality without knowledge of internal code structure. Testers focus solely on inputs and expected outputs.

---

##  White-box Testing
White-box Testing involves examining internal logic, design, and code structure of an application. Test cases are created with visibility into source code and internal paths.
